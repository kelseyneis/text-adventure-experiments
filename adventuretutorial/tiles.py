This is always the best half minute of the day. You wonder how much stress could have been saved back in the day had people gone for a more soothing sound to wake up to. If you had any other non-electronic options, you'd surely choose any one of them over the ear-splitting repetition of pounding bells you've been subjecting yourself to for the past two weeks. You miss your Spotify Handel playlist, but you can't risk it anymore. And the blissful moment of forgetfulness is over as you settle into the realization that everything is exactly as it was when you went to bed. You look around, but you can't see much. On the bedside table is the alarm clock, your glasses, a huge pair of what look like pink fluffy earmuffs, and a crumpled newspaper."""
